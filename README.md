# manual-nonogram-solver
There seems to be lots of websites that allow you to create a nonogram from the solution and many automatic solvers, but I couldn't find one where you can input a nonogram clue you've found floating around and then solve it manually. Hence I made this simple page that just uses https://github.com/HandsomeOne/Nonogram to provide that.

The main motivation for making this was to solve Pomu Rainpuff's outfit debut nonogram clue, so the text file contains it in a format that can be pasted to the solver.
